# Simple Feed Reader

A modern RSS feed reader application built with .NET 9.0, featuring Azure Search integration and AI-powered chat capabilities.

## Scenario, Goals, and Stretch Goals
### Scenario
ðŸš€ Azure Update Explorer: Unleash the Power of AI Search & Generative Chat!
 
Congrats! Youâ€™ve kicked off your Azure Updates implementation and already have RSS feeds and data displaying on the web. But nowâ€¦ the real adventure begins!

The Challenge:
You have a treasure trove of Azure updates in the Azure Updates feed, and you need to start vectorizing and storing them for smarter search. Now imagine if you could chat with your data, get lightning-fast summaries, context-rich insights, and even prioritize what matters most to YOUâ€”all supercharged by modern AI! Utilize the Azure rss feed for your data, vectorize the data, and Store it in AI Search. [RSS Feed](https://www.microsoft.com/releasecommunications/api/v2/azure/rss)
 

### Goals
1. Ingest and Vectorize Recent Updates:
  On the UI you have the ability to select one or many updates, but the load to AI Search has not been finished. Ensure each update is saved, processed, and vectorized for advanced search capabilities.  
2. Automated Content Summarization and Tagging:  
Leverage AI to automatically extract summaries from each update, assign resource tags (e.g., service names, categories), and enrich each entry with additional context using another agent or even Bing Grounding.
3. The example already has SemanticKernel and a chat interface so hook it all together.
4. Centralized Vector Store:  
Store the processed and enriched update records in an AI Search-compatible vector database to serve as the backbone for semantic search for end-users.  
5. Cost Calculator Integration:  
Build an MCP-based tool server that extracts relevant data from the Azure Retail Prices API. Integrate this cost and resource information to assist users in refining and contextualizing their searches (e.g., by cost impact, available SKUs, regional pricing).
 

## Stretch Goals
1. Priority-Based Update Schema:  
Design and implement a prioritization schema that allows classification of updates by importance to specific customer interests. For example, assign higher priority to updates for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), ACA (App Container Apps), and containers if these are mission-critical. Security-related updates can also be tagged as â€˜high priorityâ€™ for customers focusing on compliance and risk reduction.   
2. ACR Impact and Downtime Evaluation:  
Extend update processing to evaluate the impact of changes, especially as it relates to Azure Container Registry (ACR). This includes potential downtime, migration requirements, and operational risks. Summarize and flag updates that might affect service availability or require customer action.

## Features

- **RSS Feed Reading**: Retrieve and display RSS feeds from any valid feed URL
- **Azure Search Integration**: Automatically index RSS feed content for fast, full-text search
- **AI Chat**: Powered by Azure OpenAI for intelligent conversations
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS
- **Cloud-Ready**: Designed for deployment to Azure Container Apps

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/azd-install)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for containerization)
- Azure subscription

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simple-feed-reader
   ```

2. Configure Azure services (optional for local development):
   ```bash
   # Copy appsettings template
   cp SimpleFeedReader/appsettings.json SimpleFeedReader/appsettings.Development.json
   
   # Edit appsettings.Development.json and add your Azure service endpoints:
   # - AzureOpenAI section (Endpoint, ApiKey, DeploymentName)
   # - AzureSearchEndpoint, AzureSearchApiKey, AzureSearchIndexName
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project SimpleFeedReader
   ```

4. Open your browser to `https://localhost:5001`

### Azure Deployment with azd

This application includes complete Azure Developer CLI (azd) configuration for one-click deployment to Azure.

1. **Initialize the deployment**:
   ```bash
   azd init
   ```

2. **Deploy to Azure**:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

   This will:
   - Create Azure resources (Container Apps, Azure Search, Azure OpenAI, etc.)
   - Build and deploy the application
   - Configure all necessary service connections

3. **Access your deployed application**:
   ```bash
   azd show
   ```

## Architecture

### Azure Resources

The application deploys the following Azure resources:

- **Azure Container Apps**: Hosts the web application
- **Azure Cognitive Search**: Provides full-text search capabilities for RSS content
- **Azure OpenAI**: Powers the AI chat functionality
- **Azure Container Registry**: Stores the application container image
- **Azure Log Analytics**: Application monitoring and logging
- **Managed Identity**: Secure service-to-service authentication

### Application Components

- **SimpleFeedReader**: Main web application (.NET 9.0 Razor Pages)
