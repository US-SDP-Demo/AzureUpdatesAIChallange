3. **Add content enrichment pipeline**
   - Integrate summarization into RSS processing workflow. Process the feed from https://www.microsoft.com/releasecommunications/api/v2/azure/rss.
   - Store generated summaries and tags in search index
   - Add metadata enrichment for better searchability

4. **Create tagging system**
   - Design tag schema for Azure updates (service type, impact level, category)
   - Implement tag persistence in database/search index
   - Add UI components to display tags

#### Code Changes Required:
- Create `Services/SummarizationService.cs`
- Update `ViewModels/NewsStoryViewModel.cs` to include summary and tags
- Modify RSS processing pipeline in `NewsService.cs`
- Add tag display components in Razor pages

### Goal 3: Hook Together SemanticKernel and Chat Interface

**Objective**: Integrate the existing SemanticKernel and chat interface to enable AI-powered conversations about Azure updates.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Enhance ChatService with search integration**
   - Modify `Services/ChatService.cs` to query the search index through middleware tooling.
   - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with news to provide updates.

2. **Create chat plugins for Azure updates**
   - Use Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Plugins.OpenAPI.Extensions and KIOTA to generate an app manifest 

3. **Implement context-aware responses**
   - Enhance chat prompts to include relevant Azure update context
   - Add citation support to reference specific updates in responses
   - Implement follow-up question suggestions

4. **Add specialized chat capabilities**
   - Create Azure-specific conversation flows
   - Add support for asking about specific services or update types
   - Implement trend analysis and update comparison features

#### Code Changes Required:
- Update `Services/ChatService.cs` with search integration
- Create SemanticKernel plugins in new `Plugins/` folder
- Enhance chat UI with update-specific features
- Add context management for conversational flow

   - Create OpenAPI specification for Azure Retail Prices API
   - Implement SemanticKernel OpenAPI plugin for pricing data access
   - Add caching mechanism for pricing data using memory or Redis

2. **Build SemanticKernel pricing functions**
   - Create plugin functions for price lookups by service/region using OpenAPI
   - Implement cost estimation algorithms for different usage scenarios
   - Add pricing comparison functions across regions and tiers
   - Create cost optimization recommendation functions

3. **Integrate pricing with search and chat**
   - Enhance search results to include cost impact information
